## Statement of Work (SOW)  - Accessibility

**Introduction and Scope:**

1. **Project Objective:** Include a clear statement that the project aims to develop a website or application that is fully accessible to individuals with disabilities in accordance with relevant accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1).

**Accessibility Standards:**

2. **Specify Standards:** Clearly mention the specific accessibility standards that must be followed. For example, you can state that the project must adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at a minimum. Provide the level of conformance required (e.g., Level AA).

3. **Legal Compliance:** Include a clause indicating that the website or application must comply with relevant legal requirements, such as Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (for U.S. federal agencies) or similar legislation in your region.

**Testing and Evaluation:**

4. **Accessibility Testing:** Outline the requirement for comprehensive accessibility testing throughout the development process. Specify that testing should involve individuals with disabilities and use both automated and manual testing methods.

5. **Accessibility Tools:** Specify the use of accessibility testing tools and resources to identify and address accessibility issues during development and before deployment.

6. **Testing Frequency:** Define the frequency of accessibility testing (e.g., after each major development phase) and specify that any identified issues must be promptly addressed and resolved.

**Design and Development:**

7. **Accessible Design:** Emphasize that the user interface and overall design should be created with accessibility in mind. Mention the use of proper color contrast, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation.

8. **Alternative Text:** Specify that all non-text content (images, videos, etc.) must have appropriate alternative text that conveys the content and function to users with disabilities.

9. **Keyboard Accessibility:** Indicate that the website or application must be fully navigable and usable using only a keyboard, without relying on mouse-based interactions.

**Documentation and Training:**

10. **Accessibility Documentation:** Require that comprehensive documentation be provided detailing the steps taken to ensure accessibility compliance. This should include a summary of accessibility tests conducted and any issues identified and resolved.

11. **User Training:** If applicable, mention the need for training sessions or materials for content authors and developers to maintain and update the website or application in an accessible manner.

**Compliance Verification:**

12. **Third-Party Verification:** Specify that an independent accessibility audit or verification may be conducted to ensure compliance with accessibility standards before final acceptance.

**Maintenance and Support:**

13. **Ongoing Accessibility:** Mention that accessibility must be maintained throughout the lifecycle of the project, including post-launch updates and ongoing support.

**Penalties and Remedies:**

14. **Non-Compliance Penalties:** Consider including provisions for penalties or remedies if accessibility requirements are not met, such as delayed project timelines or withholding of payments.

**Legal and Compliance Statements:**

15. **Legal Compliance:** Ensure that the SOW includes a statement affirming compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to accessibility.
